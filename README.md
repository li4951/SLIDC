An implementation of the Paper whose name is Symbol-Level Synchronization and LDPC Code Design for Insertion/Deletion Channels

Field: LDPC code & BCJR Algorithm

In the following, I do not discuss the algorithm because few people can interested in it. I just record something gains in coding.

Although I am not interested in the field so much now, but coding is alaways a beautiful thing. So I implemented this project in real earnest, I refactor it several times and every time I can gains many knowledge.

In the process, I studied follows:

1. memory management: I can not forget that I can not do anyting with my PC when I forget "delete" the memory I allocated. The scene that I monitor the memory graph and was so frustrated is so clear in my mind.

2. a clear code is so beneficial to the speed and quality of development.

3. continious integration is necessary for our confidence.

4. refoctor is good for following development.
Thanks!
